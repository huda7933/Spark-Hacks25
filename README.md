# EcoMarket

## Description
Our website helps small businesses connect with each other and reduce waste. 
Any legitimate small business can sign up with us using just their Facebook account or by using their official business name. 
On their dashboard, they can view their orders, listing, previous transactions, and stats. 
They can also leave reviews about their experience with the businesses they have worked with, search for other businesses they might want to work with.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the theme of ocean conservation as well as elevating small businesses. 
We want to connect businesses that have to throw away excess or byproducts, to other business that can use them. 
A coffee shop which usually throws out coffee grounds can sell them instead to a florist since coffee grounds are good fertilizers. 
This helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.

## How We Built it
We built this website using React, HTML and CSS. We started out by laying out the outline and design of our website using Figma. 
With the databases of small business available from the city of Chicago, we verified the name of the small business to sign in to our website, alternatively they can easily connect using their Facebook account.
